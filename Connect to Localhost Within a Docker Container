When working with Docker, you usually containerize the services that form your stack and use inter-container networking 
to communicate between them. Sometimes you might need a container to talk to a service on your 
host that hasn’t been containerized. Here’s how to access localhost or 127.0.0.1 from within a Docker container.

localhost and 127.0.0.1 – These resolve to the container.
host.docker.internal – This resolves to the outside host.

docker run -d --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway my-container:latest

Connecting to the Host Network !!!
docker run -d --network=host my-container:latest


You’ve got several options when you need to reach outside a Docker container to your machine’s localhost. If you’re on Windows or Mac, 
it’s best to use the built-in host.docker.internal alias. 
Linux users can setup something similar with the --add-host flag when starting a container.
